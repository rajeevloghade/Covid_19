						to follow :</h5>

				<br>
				<div class=" extradiv col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-12">
					<h5 class="text-primary">Hand Washing</h5>
					<p>Regularly wash your hands with soap and water, or with an
						handrub(sanitiser) with atleast 20 seconds.</p>

					<h5 class="text-primary">Use Mask</h5>
					<p>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, the dispose of the
						tissue safely. Stay home when you are sick.</p>

					<h5 class="text-primary">Maintain Social Distancing</h5>
					<p>When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
						droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
						are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
						COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</p>

					<h5 class="text-primary">Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h5>
					<p>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
						contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or
						mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you
						sick.</p>

					<h5 class="text-primary">Practice respiratory hygiene</h5>
					<p>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
						respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with
						your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose
						of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By
						following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around
						you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</p>

					<h5 class="text-primary">If you have fever, cough and
						difficulty breathing, seek medical care early</h5>
					<p>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
						difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
						Follow the directions of your local health authority.</p>
